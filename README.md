# Basic-Port-Scanner
This is a very basic port scanner made with Python. The socket module is required but is part of the Python standard library.
This port scanner works by using socket in Python. The user inputs a website URL and the desired ports, as inputted by the user, are scanned.
The user can choose if they want to see error messages (timed out or denied access) and the range of ports to scan. 
Individual ports outside of the range can be scanned afterward.
The output shows the open ports in the format of the port number followed by the ip, the banner, the protocol, and whether or not it's secure.\n
It should be noted that this code should be used strictly for educational purposes. Many legal issues can come with port scanning, so only scan websites that give explicit permission.
